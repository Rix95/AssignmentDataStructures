Assignment 1 -Word Parser – Team 11 - CS 2326 

Ricardo’s tasks consisted in designing a general layout for the assignment and pseudo coding the implementation.
He created a repository to keep track of progress, changes and objectives. 
He worked on creating the classes needed to store word frequency information for each method. 
He also focused on testing and debugging the program.


Ernesto tasks were based on parsing the text file. He created a method to parse the lines, sentences and words:
This was done by iterating through each line, dividing them based on escape character at the end of a line. 
Then the parsed lines were divided into sentences by delimiting them based on dots and the end of line.
Finally, he created a method to find words and substrings in each sentence.

Marissa’s tasks consisted in maintaining code readability, handling the file output and implementing compare logic for total word frequency problems. 
For the code readability aspect she refactored proper variable names and commented methods with their purpose. 
For the file output, she used a BufferedWriter to print the method output to file. 
For the word comparison logic, she used a priority queue with the list of all words to compare their total frequencies and get the right output.
